# Tumor-from-EEG
This project detects brain tumors from EEG (electroencephalogram) data. The system utilizes various signal processing techniques to extract features from the EEG data, including wavelet-based denoising and bandpass filtering. These features are then analyzed with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier to determine brain tumors.
