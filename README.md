This project detects brain tumors from EEG (electroencephalogram) data. The system utilizes various signal processing techniques to extract features from the EEG data, including wavelet-based denoising and bandpass filtering. These features are then analyzed with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier to determine brain tumors.

The graphical user interface (GUI) enables users to load EEG data, train a model, and classify EEG signals to detect brain tumors. The code incorporates various signal processing methods and machine learning techniques using scientific libraries within a user-friendly interface.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Loading EEG Data
Click the **Load EEG Data** button to select CSV files containing EEG signals. The CSV file should have rows representing time points and columns for EEG channels. It's better to use several EEG data for the best result. For memory limited, you can define the signal range (e.g., 0 to 3000).

### 2. Preprocessing Data
The system automatically applies a bandpass filter and wavelet denoising to clean the EEG signals. Use the GUI to define the range of EEG signal points to analyze.

### 3. Training the Model
After loading the data, click the **Train Model** button to train the ANN using the extracted features.

### 4. Tumor Detection
Once the model is trained, click **Detect Tumor** to classify EEG signals and detect tumor points.

### 5. Visualizing EEG Signals
Click **Plot EEG Data** to compare the original and denoised signals.

### 6. Resetting the Application
Use **Reset App** to clear the data and start a new analysis.
